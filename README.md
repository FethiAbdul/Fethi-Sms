# SMS Messaging Web Application Using Flask and APIs

## Overview

This project is a Flask-based web application that integrates multiple APIs to send personalized SMS messages using the Twilio API. The SMS Messaging Web Application is a Python-based project built with Flask, designed to send personalized SMS messages by integrating multiple APIs. It dynamically fetches data such as the number of people in space, weather updates for a recipient’s location, and details of a random Harry Potter character, combining these into a single, customized message. Using the Twilio API, the application ensures secure and reliable SMS delivery. It features a user-friendly web interface for triggering the message-sending process and provides visual confirmation upon success. This project showcases API integration, automation, and modular design, demonstrating how to build scalable and data-driven messaging systems for real-world applications.

## Project Features

### Core Functionalities:
1. **Send SMS Messages**:
   - Dynamically compose and send SMS messages using the Twilio API.
2. **Personalized Messaging**:
   - Include recipient-specific data such as:
     - Lucky number (randomly generated).
     - Number of people currently in space.
     - Weather information for the recipient's location.
     - Harry Potter character details.

3. **Web Interface**:
   - A simple HTML-based user interface to trigger SMS sending.
   - Confirmation page upon successful SMS delivery.

## How It Works

### Workflow:
1. **Data Retrieval**:
   - Fetches dynamic data from three external APIs:
     - Open Notify API for the number of people in space.
     - OpenWeatherMap API for weather details.
     - Harry Potter API for character information.
   - Randomly generates a lucky number.

2. **Message Composition**:
   - Combines the data with recipient information (e.g., name, location) into a single SMS message.

3. **Message Delivery**:
   - Uses the Twilio API to send the SMS to the recipient's phone number.
   - Logs the unique message SID to a JSON file for record-keeping.

4. **User Interaction**:
   - The user accesses the root page (/)link to see a button labeled "Send SMS."
   - Clicking the button triggers the SMS process and redirects to a confirmation page (/sms) with a green tick mark.

## APIs and Integrations

1. **Twilio API**:
   - For sending SMS messages programmatically.
   - Manages authentication and secure message delivery.

2. **Open Notify API**:
   - Fetches the number of people currently in space.
   - Example output: The number of people in space are 10.

3. **OpenWeatherMap API**:
   - Retrieves weather for the recipient's location.
   - Example output: The temperature in Waterloo is 25°C.

4. **Harry Potter API**:
   - Provides details of a random Harry Potter character.
   - Example output: Hermione Granger is in the house Wizard, and the actor is Emma Watson.`

## Skills Demonstrated

This project showcases the following skills:

1. **Programming and Development**:
   - **Python:** Writing clean and modular code to implement the backend logic.
   - **Flask:** Developing a web application with routes, rendering templates, and serving static files.

2. **API Integration**:
   - **Twilio API:** Sending SMS messages programmatically, including handling authentication and message delivery.
   - **Open Notify API:** Fetching real-time data on the number of people in space.
   - **OpenWeatherMap API:** Fetching and processing weather data for specific locations.
   - **Harry Potter API:** Retrieving random Harry Potter character details, including additional logic for data manipulation.

3. **Data Processing**:
   - **JSON Handling:** Parsing API responses and saving data locally for record-keeping.
   - **Randomization:** Using Python's random module to generate dynamic, personalized content (e.g., lucky numbers).

4. **Communication and Automation**:
   - Combining multiple data sources into a cohesive, personalized SMS message.
   - Automating the message-sending process for multiple users dynamically.

5. **Testing and Debugging**:
   - Ensuring reliable API calls and validating that the web interface functions as intended.
   - Handling errors in API responses or user data.
